# CORS
This repository stores the executable files of two algorithms proposed in the paper **Cross Online Ride-sharing for Shared Mobilities in Spatial Crowdsourcing**

## Usage of the algorithms

### Environment

Python 3.9 and Wolfram application.



### Run the algorithms

Run "GenerateData.py" in **DecisionTreeModel** folder to generate the training and test data of generating decision tree model.

Run "DecisionTree.py" in **DecisionTreeModel** folder to generate the decision tree model used in D-CORS.

Run "Simulator.py" in **SimulateCORS** folder to perform R-CORS and D-CORS proposed in the paper.

### Datasets

The real datasets are from the website of GAIA. We provide some data example in [realdata](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KaxU4g23Pdup14Auf1hzpg). The password is 0bbw.

The synthetic datasets are generated from the real datasets.
